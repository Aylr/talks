2. How to crush pipeline debt
3. Live demo

# Pipeline Debt

![right fit](leviathan.jpg)

# [fit] Pipelines are like software.
## And also not.

|                       |     Software    |   Pipelines   |
|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| _inputs are_          | usually known   | often unknown |
| _assumptions are_     | often crisp     | murky         |
| _failures created by_ | your code       | data creators |
| _tests verify_        | code            | data          |
| _tests run_           | at compile time | at run time   |

# But why test pipelines?

1. Risk mitigation
2. Pager mitigation
3. Increase trust & credibility
4. Codify knowledge & assumptions

# [fit] Great Expectations

![inline scale: 85%](pip.png)
# [fit] **_Always know what to expect from your data_**

^ open source python package
^ started in 2017

## Expectations are assertions about data

- `expect_file_size_to_be_between`
- `expect_table_row_count_to_be_between`
- `expect_column_to_exist`
- `expect_column_values_to_not_be_null`
- `expect_column_values_to_be_unique`
- `expect_column_values_to_be_between`
- `expect_column_values_to_be_in_set`
- `expect_column_values_to_match_regex`
- `expect_column_mean_to_be_between`
- `expect_column_kl_divergence_to_be_less_than`
- ... and many many more[^1]

^ declarative
almost 50 of them
you can create custom ones for your domain

---

# Where's does the compute happen?
### **_Great Expectations uses different back-end compute engines_**

- pandas
- Spark
- Common relational databases via SQLAlchemy
    + Redshift
    + BigQuery
    + Snowflake
    + Postgres
    + MySQL

^ Expectations are written in python and compiled to execute natively on the compute engine.

# [fit] Tests are docs
# [fit] **_and_**
# [fit] Docs are tests

^ lets look closer

---

# Tests are docs and docs are tests
![left fit](datadocs.gif)

- Everything is JSON ðŸ¤–
- Compile to HTML or Notebooks ðŸ¤—
- Docs cannot get stale!

^ expectations are JSON
validations are JSON
as long as you run tests you docs CANNOT get stale

# How to crush pipeline debt

[.column]
## _**data ingest**_
especially if the data isn't controlled your team

## _**before & after ML models**_
prevent malfeasant AI

[.column]
## _**analytic warehouses**_
Be good data driven.

## _**critical dashboard tables**_
Don't piss off an executive

^ Ok. Where do we start?

# Misc

## Backstory

## Funding & Philosophy

We raised a round from CRV and Root Ventures late last year, so we have two full years of runway to work on Great Expectations.

At some point, we'll build a paid SaaS product on top of Great Expectations, but for now we're just making the open source project as useful as it can be.

We're firmly committed to keeping Great Expectations open: everything that is open source will always remain open source.
