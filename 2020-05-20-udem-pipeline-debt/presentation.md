# Pipeline Debt

![right fit](leviathan.jpg)

# Pipelines are like software.
# And also not.

|                       |     Software    |   Pipelines   |
|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| _inputs are_          | usually known   | often unknown |
| _assumptions are_     | often crisp     | murky         |
| _failures created by_ | your code       | data creators |
| _tests verify_        | code            | data          |
| _tests run_           | at compile time | at run time   |

# But why test pipelines?

1. Risk mitigation
2. Pager mitigation
3. Increase trust & credibility
4. Codify knowledge & assumptions

---

# What types of risk can we mitigate?

1. Pipeline risks
2. Data risks

# Great Expectations

![inline scale: 75%](pip.png)
### Always know what to expect from your data

---

[.build-lists: true]

## Expectations are assertions about data

- `expect_file_size_to_be_between`
- `expect_table_row_count_to_be_between`
- `expect_column_to_exist`
- `expect_column_values_to_not_be_null`
- `expect_column_values_to_be_unique`
- `expect_column_values_to_be_between`
- `expect_column_values_to_be_in_set`
- `expect_column_values_to_match_regex`
- `expect_column_mean_to_be_between`
- `expect_column_kl_divergence_to_be_less_than`
- ... and many many more[^1]

# Where's does the compute happen?
### **_Great Expectations uses different back-end compute engines_**

- pandas
- Spark
- Common relational databases via SQLAlchemy
    + Redshift
    + BigQuery
    + Snowflake
    + Postgres
    + MySQL

^ Expectations are written in python and compiled to execute natively on the compute engine.

# [fit] Tests are docs

# Tests are docs and docs are tests

- Everything is JSON ðŸ¤–
- Compile to HTML or Notebooks ðŸ¤—
- Docs cannot get stale!

# How to crush pipeline debt

[.column]
## _**data ingest**_
especially if the data isn't controlled your team

## _**before & after ML models**_
prevent malfeasant AI

[.column]
## _**analytic warehouses**_
Be good data driven.

## _**critical dashboard tables**_
Don't piss off an executive

# Misc

## Backstory

## Funding & Philosophy

We raised a round from CRV and Root Ventures late last year, so we have two full years of runway to work on Great Expectations.

At some point, we'll build a paid SaaS product on top of Great Expectations, but for now we're just making the open source project as useful as it can be.

We're firmly committed to keeping Great Expectations open: everything that is open source will always remain open source.
