## Expectations are assertions about data

- `expect_file_size_to_be_between`
- `expect_table_row_count_to_be_between`
- `expect_column_to_exist`
- `expect_column_values_to_not_be_null`
- `expect_column_values_to_be_unique`
- `expect_column_values_to_be_between`
- `expect_column_values_to_be_in_set`
- `expect_column_values_to_match_regex`
- `expect_column_mean_to_be_between`
- `expect_column_kl_divergence_to_be_less_than`
- ... and many many more[^1]

^ declarative
almost 50 of them
you can create custom ones for your domain

# Where's does the compute happen?
### **_Great Expectations uses different back-end compute engines_**

- pandas
- Spark
- Common relational databases via SQLAlchemy
    + Redshift
    + BigQuery
    + Snowflake
    + Postgres
    + MySQL

^ Expectations are written in python and compiled to execute natively on the compute engine.

# [fit] Tests are docs
# [fit] **_and_**
# [fit] Docs are tests

^ lets look closer

---

# Tests are docs and docs are tests
![left fit](datadocs.gif)

- Everything is JSON ðŸ¤–
- Compile to HTML or Notebooks ðŸ¤—
- Docs cannot get stale!

^ expectations are JSON
validations are JSON
as long as you run tests you docs CANNOT get stale

# How to crush pipeline debt

[.column]
## _**data ingest**_
especially if the data isn't controlled your team

## _**before & after ML models**_
prevent malfeasant AI

[.column]
## _**analytic warehouses**_
Be good data driven.

## _**critical dashboard tables**_
Don't piss off an executive

^ Ok. Where do we start?
